Conference Review Simulation
============================

This is mostly for fun but might help inform decisions around changes to conference review processes. There was much discussion around the ICSE 2017 PC chairs propoal to limit the number of papers per author to 3. By making, what I think are decent, assumption and guesstimates I built a stochastic simulation model. By running it for a total of 1.2 million simulated review processes I conclude that the proposed author limit is unlikely to have a big effect on either the total review effort or on the number of research groups whose papers are accepted. 

Naturally, these conclusions are heavily dependent on the initial assumptions and models used in the simulation. Thus this comes with a **BIG** **disclaimer**: **I'm sure one can arrive at different conclusions if having different assumptions or postulating other models**. Please mail me yours and we can update/compare. :)

Feel free to contact me with your proposed changes or ideas to improve this and consider more scenarios / input assumptions. Or just fork this repo and make any changes / simulations you want. :)
